Unemployed looking for a job
Hello, I'm Facundo Perdomo a guy from Uruguay looking for a job as a programmer, it's my biggest hobby to be a programmer.
I'm taking courses at FreeCodeCamp and a few days ago I got certified in responsive web development, covering html and css. And I'm going to continue with javascript although I already have previous knowledge of the language because of some courses I did on youtube.
I like computer science so much that all my studies have been on that side.
I like soccer very much, it is a sport that I play since I was a kid although temporarily I don't play it since I am studying.
I love listening to music all the time, either playing videogames or doing nothing, videogames are my favorite hobby.
I like reading books, I'm currently reading ready player two (I already read one and it's very good), the best books I've ever read and my favorites.
